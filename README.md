# Gaussian-Filter-Verilog-Implementation
In this project we used Verilog hardware description language, to form a gaussian filter for removing noise from images.

Verilog was chosen, to ensure the scalability of the project, i.e... to process images in real time using a FPGA.


-
Code and results for color images and code and results for black and white images are divided

I am attaching the PPT file for your understanding
